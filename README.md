# GPT-Standard

## GPT Session Save File (GSSF) Standard Repository

The GPT-Standard repository hosts a living web standard that combines JSON and Markdown in a unique hybrid `.gpt` file format. Designed to be the gold standard for saving GPT sessions, it promises to make every interaction meaningful by preserving its rich context.

### Purpose

The GSSF Standard is our answer to 'GPT Amnesia.' By creating a universal format for session saving, we're setting the stage for future interactions to be more insightful and coherent.

### Metadata

Metadata isn't just data about data; it's the soul of any GPT session. Here are the new fields we're introducing:
- **User Profile**: A snapshot of the user, capturing preferences and past interactions.
- **Session Tags**: Keywords that encapsulate the essence of the session.
- **Language**: The primary language used during the interaction.
- **Device Info**: The device used to access the GPT model.
- **Custom Fields**: Tailor-made fields for specific applications.

### Security and Privacy

Security isn't an afterthought; it's integral to the GSSF. We're committed to safeguarding user data through rigorous protocols, ensuring compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations.
